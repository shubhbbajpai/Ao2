        Complexity:

        Best Case: O(n*log(n)) - Due to the sorting operation by mergesort which has complexity
        of O(n*log(n)) and n is the number of items/keys in the infinite hash table. The best-case
        scenario would occur when all keys are present at the level 0 with no nested hash tables.

        Worst Case: O(n*log(n)) - Due to the sorting operation by mergesort which has complexity
        of O(n*log(n)) and n is the number items/keys in the infinite hash table.
        In the worst-case scenario, the keys can be distributed evenly across all nested hash tables
        up to a depth of d. The sort_keys function would be called recursively d times for each nested
        table. However, the way mergesort works, sorting the keys at each level doesn't stack
        multiplicatively with depth, since the keys are partitioned and then combined. The worst-case
        complexity will then be O(d*n + n*logn). But, Since nlogn will grow faster than dÃ—n for a large n,
        the nlogn term dominates and hence the worst case complexity.
